# dotnet format

*Update* Microsoft has come out with their own dotnet format - https://github.com/dotnet/format and asked for this namespace so I let them use it. If I work on this in the future it will be under a different name.

A dotnet global tool, using resharper command line tools, to format your solution.

## Install

`dotnet tool install -g dotnet-format`

## Run

`dotnet format your-solution.sln`

## Update

`dotnet tool update -g dotnet-format`
